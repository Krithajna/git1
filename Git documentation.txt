### how to untrack the file mission is adding new file and then untacking

F:\new file>git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        c.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

F:\new file>git add .

F:\new file>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   c.txt


F:\new file>git restore --staged "c.text"
error: pathspec 'c.text' did not match any file(s) known to git

F:\new file>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   c.txt


F:\new file>git restore --staged <c.txt>
The syntax of the command is incorrect.

F:\new file>git restore --staged "c.txt"

F:\new file>git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        c.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
